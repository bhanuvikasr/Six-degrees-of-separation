# Six-degrees-of-separation
## Abstract
In this assignment we explore the "Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon" game. Specifically, we designed and implemented the data structures and algorithms necessary to explore degrees of separation between Hollywood actors that act in the same movies. The main focus of this assignment is to design and implement efficient graph-based data structures and use them to explore large graphs.
